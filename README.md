# Railway-Station-management

‘Indian railways’ is a lifeline to the nation. 
It is a significant contributor to nation’s economy. 
Without railways, the nation would lack an efficient transport system, especially in terms of freight transportation. 
Signals are a major aspect in railways. They are also an apt application of sequential circuitry. 
There are various signals: inside and outside the station premises. 
All these signals are considered to be individual components, meaning, for a route to be set in or out of the station, 
every signal has to be set manually by means of a physical switch. 
This might lead to unnecessary delays, where in an official might forget to set the signals for a particular route. 
In our work, we try to automate this signaling process, reducing unnecessary delays caused by human error, thereby enhancing the management of railway stations.
